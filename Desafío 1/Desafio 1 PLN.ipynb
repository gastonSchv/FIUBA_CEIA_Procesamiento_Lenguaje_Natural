    "A partir del análisis realizado con la matriz traspuesta y la posterior evaluación de la similitud coseno entre los vectores que esperábamos tuvieran algun grado de representatividad para las palabras, podemos mencionar que hay elementos para plantear que existe información encapsulada en dichos vectores, ya que muchas de las palabras con mayor grado de similitud tienen una conexión semántica con la palabra base. Dado el amplio vocabulario existente en este corpus, esto es un indicativo de que los vectores obtenido de la transposición realizada contienen información relevante respecto a los términos que representan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sin embargo, a pesar de observar un cierto grado de representación, es importante notar que muchos de los resultados obtenidos no poseen una conexión estrecha con la palabra base, por lo que no se considera que este método, al menos en los términos planteados, pueda utilizarse de forma general para plantear similitud entre palabras, sino que se necesitaría buscar algún mecanismo de mejora o postular algún otro método que logre capturar de manera más precisa lo buscado."
